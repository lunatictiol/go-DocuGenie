Project Name: go-DocuGenie
Main Language: Go
Description: go-DocuGenie is a tool for generating summaries of Go projects. It can read files in various formats and generate a concise summary of the project's contents.

Features/Tech Stack:

* Go language
* Cobra command line framework
* File scanning and parsing using the `go-DocuGenie` package
* Support for multiple file types, including Go source code, YAML configuration files, and Markdown documentation

Getting Started:
To get started with go-DocuGenie, simply run the command `go-docuGenie generate`. The tool will scan the project and generate a summary of its contents.

Folder Structure/Key Files:
The tool expects to find the following files in the root directory of your project:

* `cmd` - contains the command-line interface for go-DocuGenie
* `main.go` - the main entry point for the application
* `parser` - contains file parsers and summarizers for different file types
* `summarizer.go` - the language-specific summarizer for Go projects
* `types.go` - contains type definitions for the `go-DocuGenie` package

The tool also expects to find a `config.yaml` file in the root directory of your project, which contains configuration settings for the tool.

Inferring Project Name and Language:
By default, go-DocuGenie will infer the project name and language from the current folder path. If you want to specify a different project name or language, you can do so by passing the`-f` flag to the command. For example, `go-docuGenie generate -f .go`.

Requires local ollama setup to run.
